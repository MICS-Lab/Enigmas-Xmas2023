\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	
	Santa's magical reindeer are getting old.
	In order to have no disruption in the distribution of presents when the reindeer can no longer fly, Santa is testing a new model of sleigh from the future: a laser-powered sleigh.
	
	The concept is simple: Santa Clause needs to ask the elves to construct towers at regular intervals.
	They will take it in turns to propel the sleigh via ultra-powerful lasers.
	To prevent the sled from disintegrating, it is fitted with a shield at the rear.

	If $D$ id the distance between the sleigh and the tower, the energy transmitted by the tower is proportional to $1/D$ (due to interaction of the laser with the atmosphere).
	The speed of the sleigh is proportional to the energy it receives from the tower.
